# Price_tracking-Chrome-Extension
I have built a chrome extension of Price tracking that is scraping top 10 product details from amazon based on that area's pincode. I have craeted an amazon spider which would scrape the product details and would read them via MongoEngine. The deatils would be dumped via ElasticSearch in a json file.
